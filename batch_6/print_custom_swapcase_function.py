# Get user input
# Initialize an empty result string
# Iterate through each character in the string
    # Determine if the character is an uppercase letter using ASCII values
    # Change to lowercase by applying a 32-value ASCII adjustment
    # Change to uppercase by reducing 32 from its ASCII value
    # Keep non-alphabetic characters unchanged
# Print the result
