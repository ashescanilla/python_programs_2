# Get user input
# Initialize an empty result string
# Iterate through each character in the string
    # Determine if the character is an uppercase letter (A-Z)
        # Convert the character to lowercase using ASCII value adjustment
        # Keep the character unchanged if it's not uppercase
# Print the converted lowercase string
